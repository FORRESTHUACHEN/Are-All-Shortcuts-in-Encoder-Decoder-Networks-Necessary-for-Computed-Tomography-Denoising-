Code and Supplementary Materials for manuscript 'Are All Shortcuts in Encoder-Decoder Networks Necessary for Computed Tomography Denoising?'

The aim of this project is finding out the necessarity of all shortcuts in encoder-decoder network for medcial image denoising task. In deep learning era, a series of publications have shown that generative model based methods has become the state-of-art method. As an important generative model, encoder-decoder network has been used in medical image denoising. Shortcuts are improtant parts for encoder-decoder network when it was used for segmentation and style transfer, however, are they still important for denoising task? More details of about this paper you can find in our papers. Here are the codes of paper'Are All Shortcuts in Encoder-Decoder Networks Necessary for CT Denoising?'
