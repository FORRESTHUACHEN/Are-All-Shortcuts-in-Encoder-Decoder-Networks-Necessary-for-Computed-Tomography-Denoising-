Code and Supplementary Materials for manuscript 'Are All Shortcuts in Encoder-Decoder Networks Necessary for Computed Tomography Denoising?'

The aim of this project is finding out the necessarity of all shortcuts in encoder-decoder network for medcial image denoising task. In deep learning era, a series of publications [1-4] have shown that generative model based methods has become the state-of-art method. As an important generative model, encoder-decoder network has been used in
